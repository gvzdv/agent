# Panza: Personal Agent for Notifications, Zest, and Assistance

Note: the agent is in active development, and I plan to release the functional application during the week of January 13th.

### Features
- Managing Google calendar (adding meetings and reporting on meeting itineraries by request)
- Weather forecasts by request
- Gmail management: reports on unread emails
- Streamlining journaling: reminders about daily diary entries and writing content in Notion
- Voice message transcriptions
- General support and encouragement!
